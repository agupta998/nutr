This document describes the idealized detector setup of the Clover Array.

## Coordinate System

In the Clover Array geometries, a right-handed cartesian coordinate system is used. The direction 
of propagation of the beam defines the positive z axis, and the positive y axis is assumed to 
point upwards. Usually, the HIγS beam is linearly polarized along the x axis. The polar angle 
theta is defined with respect to the z axis, i.e. theta = 0 deg is the direction of the beam, and
theta = 180 deg is pointing upstream. The positive x axis is defined by theta = 90 deg and an 
azimuthal angle phi = 0 deg. The positive y axis is theta = 90 deg and phi = 90 deg.

## Clover-type high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors

From February 2021 to October 2021, the Clover Array could hold up to 8 clover detectors at a
polar angle of 90 deg and 6 clover detectors at backward angles. In November 2021, the backward-
angle position B3 was added at a polar angle of 125.26 degrees. After the last experiment of the 
fall-2021 campaign, the polar angle of B3 was modified to the originally planned angle of 135 
degress.

About the odd polar angle of some of the backward-angle detectors, see footnote [1].

The clover detectors are not rotationally symmetric around their main axis. Therefore, it is 
crucial to have the correct orientation of the detectors in the simulation. In reality, the clover
detectors have different different color codes on their front faces, but the crystal positions are
in most cases marked with "E1", "E2", "E3", and "E4" in clockwise order. The only exception is 
clover detector "Yale 142051" for which the signal cables of E1 and E4 are swapped with respect to
the labels on its front face. If they are color coded, most of the clover detectors have the 
following coloring:

Channel - Color
E1        Blue
E2        Red
E3        Green
E4        Brown

In the simulation, all clover detectors, even Yale 142051, follow this coloring scheme, because 
they are all built from the same base class.

## Coaxial HPGe detectors

On any of the clover-detector positions, a large-volume 100% relative efficiency coaxial HPGe can 
also be mounted.

## Cerium-bromide scintillators

In addition to the clover detectors, the metal frame can hold up to 8 2"x2" CeBr detectors at a 
polar angle of 90 deg, and 14 CeBr detectors at a polar angle of 135 deg.

## Cerium-doped lanthanum-bromide detectors

There also exist holders to mount 3"x3" LaBr detectors at any of the clover or CeBr positions.

## Filters

For the clover, CeBr, and LaBr detectors, custom-made copper and lead filters exist whose 
dimensions fit the front faces of the detectors. For all detectors, special 3D-printed plastic cups
exist to mount the filters. For all other detectors, the filters were usually simply taped on the 
detector faces.
The filter cases of the close-packed clover detectors (for example B4 and B5) overlap slightly in 
the simulation at their nominal distance of 8", because the gap was also very narrow in reality. 
The experimenters usually managed to put them on anyway by using gentle force or cutting off the
corners of the plastic pieces. The overlaps should not affect the simulated results significantly 
in typical use cases.

The available filter thicknesses are as follows:

Material - Thickness - Description
CeBr
Cu         0.040"      thin
Cu         0.082"      thick
Pb         0.038"      very thin
Pb         0.046"      thin
Pb         0.101"      thick

Clover
Cu         0.040"      thin
Cu         0.081"      thick
Pb         0.038"      very thin
Pb         0.045"      thin
Pb         0.101"      thick

LaBr
Pb         0.100"      thick

[1] For the backward-angle detectors B2, B4, B6, and B8 the following information was given to UFG 
by the engineer Mark Emamian (quote from an email which holds for all four detectors):

"the angle between the clover detector’s central axis (or its base plate) and
the horizontal plate is 35.26 degree. And the angle between the detector’s
central axis and the gamma beam is 54.74 degrees"

As opposed to the usual polar angle of 135 degrees that is optimized for the expected angular 
correlations in photonuclear experiments, the four detectors were designed to be right on top of 
each other when viewed from above. If they were all at a polar angle of 135 degrees, their face 
centers would lie on a circle, instead. In spherical coordinates, the information above implies 
that the polar angle of the detectors is

theta = 180 deg - 54.74 deg = 125.26 deg

(Mark gave the equivalent acute angle).

To obtain the azimuthal angle, note that the angle of 35.26 deg given by Mark is the projection of
the detector axis on the x-z plane. A short calculation gives phi = 45 deg.
