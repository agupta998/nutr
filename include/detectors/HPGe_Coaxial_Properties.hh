// This file implements two structs.
// 1) A struct 'HPGe_Coaxial_Properties' that contains the properties of the
// front part of a specific coaxial High-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector.
// 2) A struct 'HPGe_Coaxial_Dewar_Properties' that can be used to supply the
// properties of a standard axially symmetry liquid-nitrogen dewar. The dewar
// parts are implemented mainly for visualization reasons and they are rough
// estimates of the actual structure of the dewar and the connecting piece.
