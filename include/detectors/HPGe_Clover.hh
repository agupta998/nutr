/**
 * \brief Clover-type high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector
 *
 * This class models a clover-type detector whose four crystals are made from
 * identical cylindric pieces of germanium. To be able to achieve a compact and
 * quadratic geometry, the cylindric crystals are flattened on four sides. The
 * geometry is mainly based on a "Germanium 2 Fold Segmented Clover Detector
 * OPERATING MANUAL" by Eurisys Mesures from 1997 that came with one of the
 * "Yale clover detectors" (V. Werner, private communication). The Eurisys
 * manual only shows the central holes in the germanium crystals for the anode
 * implicitly, but an experimental study of similar detectors [1] proves that
 * they exist and provided the basis for modeling the holes in this code. The
 * radius of the hole given in [1] (5 mm) agrees with the size of the implied
 * holes in the Eurisys manual. No value is given for the length of the hole,
 * but it is 8 mm shorter than the crystal length in [1].
