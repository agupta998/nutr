/**
 * \brief Class for a 3 in x 3 in LaBr3:Ce scintillation detector with a dummy
 * case.
 *
 * This class implements a simplified standard configuration of 3 in x 3 in
 * scintillation detectors as manufactured by the company Saint Gobian \cite
 * SaintGobain2021. The sensitive crystals are made of cerium-doped
 * lanthanum-bromide (LaBr3:Ce) material. The dimensions used in this
 * implementation are from a previous implementation by B. LÃ¶her and J. Isaak
 * (BI) (crystal, vacuum, and crystal housing) or from a measurement by the
 * author in 2018 (outer parts). If not indicated otherwise, dimensions were
 * read off from the technical drawings on the SCIONIX webpage for scintillation
 * crystals with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a preamplifier.
 *
 * Only the outer dimensions of the housing, but no details about the inside,
 * are known. This is why all the back parts are simply constructed as hollow
 * aluminium.
