/**
 * \brief Class for a 3 in x 3 in LaBr3:Ce scintillation detector with a dummy case.
 * 
 * This class implements a simplified standard configuration of 3 in x 3 in scintillation 
 * detectors as manufactured by the company Saint Gobian \cite SaintGobain2021.
 * The sensitive crystals are made of cerium-doped lanthanum-bromide (LaBr3:Ce) material.
 * The dimensions used in this implementation are from a previous implementation by B. LÃ¶her and 
 * J. Isaak (BI) (crystal, vacuum, and crystal housing) or from a measurement by the author in 
 * 2018 (outer parts).
 * If not indicated otherwise, dimensions were read off from the technical drawings on the SCIONIX 
 * webpage for scintillation crystals with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a preamplifier.
 * 	
 * Only the outer dimensions of the housing, but no details about the inside, are known. This 
 * is why all the back parts are simply constructed as hollow aluminium. The housing is 
 * only implemented for aesthetic reasons and can be switched off via the 'use_housing' flag.
