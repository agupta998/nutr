    """Polarization-direction correlation

It is assumed that a nucleus is excited from an initial (ini) state to an intermediate (int) \
state by the absorption of a linearly polarized photon which propagates in positive z-direction. \
The polarization axis is assumed to be along the x axis.
The intermediate excited state decays to a final (fin) state by the emission of a photon. \
The angular distribution of the emitted photon is described by this function in terms of \
the polar- and aximuthal angle in spherical coordinates.

In the following, the variable X may be any of the three state labels ini, int, or fin, \
and Xp denotes one of the labels other than X.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    theta: float
        Polar angle in radians. theta == 0 is the positive z axis.
    phi: float
        Azimuthal angle in radians. theta == 0.5*pi, phi == 0 is the positive x axis, \
theta == 0.5*pi, phi == 0.5*pi is the positive y axis.
    two_J_X: int
        Two times the angular momentum quantum number of the initial state X in units of \
the reduced Planck constant.
    p_X: int
        Parity number of the state X. p_X == -1 means negative, p_X == 1 means positive parity. \
Any other number entered for p_X will be treated like a -1.
    em_X_to_Xp: int
        Electromagnetic character of the transition from state X to Xp. em_X_to_Xp == -1 means \
electric, em_X_to_Xp == 1 means magnetic. The signs were chosen in analogy to dipole excitations \
of an even-even nucleus. Any other number entered for em_X_to_Xp will be treated like a -1.
    two_L_X_to_Xp: int
        Two times the primary multipolarity of the transition from state X to Xp.
    two_Lp_X_to_Xp: int
        Two times the secondary multipolarity of the transition from state X to Xp.
    delta_X_to_Xp: float
        Multipole mixing ratio of the two multipolarities in the transition from state X to Xp.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Angular distribution
